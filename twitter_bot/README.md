## About this bot

Arizona law SB 1070 requires law-enforcement officers to try to verify the immigration status of someone they've detained if they suspect the person is in the country illegally.

In 2014, the Arizona Daily Star [investigated](http://tucson.com/special-section/sb1070/) SB 1070 enforcement and collected records documenting local law enforcement calls to Border Patrol to check a person's immigration status.

This Twitter bot uses Arizona Department of Public Safety traffic stop data collected by the Star to simulate traffic stops when a driver's immigration status was questioned. 

When a Twitter user follows the [@Officer1070](https://twitter.com/officer1070) account, this bot simulates a traffic stop with the Twitter user's name and information such as the type of car, the observed violation and the outcome from a random traffic stop record. The bot creates a mock form for this simulated stop and tweets it back at the user.

Dan Hill created this bot for [Arizona Migrahack](http://justicejournalism.org/events/arizona-migrahack/), a 2015 event at the University of Arizona. The traffic stop data used in this project are available in this repository or from the Institute for Justice and Journalism [data portal](http://justicejournalism.org/?s=traffic+data&post_type=opendata).
